Level 1 Challenges

1a) Set up the 'Player2' cube to also move the same way 'Player1' does.  Hint: Check out how the Player1 gameobject is set up in the inspector. 

2a) Assign our gameHandler variable to be assigned to our GameHandler class using FindObjectOfType in our Start() function. 

3a) Using the Package Manager, import the synty asset Simple FX - Cartoon Particles into our project (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/simple-fx-cartoon-particles-67834).

4a) Instantiate a particle prefab of choice from the Simple FX asset pack at the position of the pad when a player cube reaches a FinishPad inside our FinishPad.cs script.  

5a) Implement some logic to detect if all Player cubes have been destroyed from the Scene.  GameHandler.cs

6a) Create a second scene and create a new level to complete.  hint:  Copy and paste our first scene and make modifications from there.  

7a) Create a Prefabs folder in our assets folder, and make our Player and Finish Pad objects prefabs we can use in later levels.  

8a) Load your second scene using the UnityEngine.SceneManagement namespace when level 1 is complete.  (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html)

9a) Create a basic Main Menu Scene for level management (Check out Rick's lecture(s) here on this topic in our 2D course ___________________).

Level 2 Challenges

1b) Modify our PlayerMovement.cs script to allow our player to jump. 

2b) Create a level with 3 dimensional obstacles, forcing our player to navigate 3d space. 

3b) Create some hazard objects that destroy our player object and force the player to restart the level.  e.g., a spike hazard that kills the player object if touched.  

4b) Create some Camera controls using the arrow keys to allow the player to navigate around our custom maps (Check out Rick's lecture(s) here on this topic in our 3D course ___________________).  

5b) Use the switch and button switch prefabs found in our prefab folder to create some custom logic that destroys correlating game objects if a player presses the button.  
	e.g., a doorway that's destroyed on after the player moves over the pad.  

6b)
