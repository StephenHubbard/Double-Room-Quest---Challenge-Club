Level 1 Challenges

1) Set up the 'Player2' cube to also move the same way 'Player1' does.  Hint: Check out how the Player1 gameobject is set up in the inspector.  Modify your moveSpeed variable
to a speed that you deem appropriate for your player(s).

2) Assign our gameHandler variable to be assigned to our GameHandler class using FindObjectOfType in our Start() function. 

3) Using the Package Manager, import a particle pack of your choice.  Instantiate a particle prefab of choice at the position of the pad when a 
player cube reaches a FinishPad inside our FinishPad.cs script.

5) Implement some logic into your GameHandler.cs class to detect if all Player cubes have been destroyed from the Scene.

6) Create a Prefabs folder in our assets folder, and make our Player and Finish Pad objects prefabs we can use in later levels.

7) Create a second scene and create a new level to complete.  hint:  Copy and paste our first scene and make modifications from there.  

8) Load your second scene using the UnityEngine.SceneManagement namespace when level 1 is complete.

9) Create a basic Main Menu Scene for level management. 

10) Create some hazard objects that destroy our player object and force the player to restart the level.  e.g., a spike hazard that kills the player object if touched.

11) Create some camera controls using the arrow keys to allow the player to navigate around our custom maps (Check out Rick's lecture(s) here on this topic in our 3D course ___________________).
