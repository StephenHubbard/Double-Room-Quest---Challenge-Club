Level 1 Challenges

1) Set up the 'Player2' cube to also move the same way 'Player1' does.  Hint: Check out how the Player1 gameobject is set up in the inspector. 

2) Assign our gameHandler variable to be assigned to our GameHandler class using FindObjectOfType in our Start() function. 

3) Using the Package Manager, import the synty asset Simple FX - Cartoon Particles into our project (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/simple-fx-cartoon-particles-67834).

4) Instantiate a particle prefab of choice from the Simple FX asset pack at the position of the pad when a player cube reaches a FinishPad inside our FinishPad.cs script.  

5) Implement some logic to detect if all Player cubes have been destroyed from the Scene.  GameHandler.cs

6) Create a second scene and create a new level to complete.  hint:  Copy and paste our first scene and make modifications from there.  

7) Create a Prefabs folder in our assets folder, and make our Player and Finish Pad objects prefabs we can use in later levels.  

8) Load your second scene using the UnityEngine.SceneManagement namespace when level 1 is complete.  (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html)
